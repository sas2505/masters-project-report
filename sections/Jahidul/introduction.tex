Software  releasing  process  can  be  procedural  in  the  conventional  software  development life-cycle(SDLC). In traditional SDLC, the software development mostly depends on the different development teams working on the different parts of the same project.  Ideally,developers  need  to  collaborate  between  themselves  to  mitigate  the  knowledge  gaps  to ensure a successful release of the software.  During the software releasing process, the code review of any changes in the existing software is very crucial in SDLC. After reviewing the code by the code review team, the new changes in the code is inspected but he testing team for the quality assurance of the new changes.  This new changes is then passes through various unit testing and integration testing by the testing team.  Furthermore,  the QA passed  patch  of  the  software  is  handed  over  the  deployment  team  who  are  responsible for  the  releasing  the  new  version  of  the  software.   This  involves  DevOps  tasks  for  the deployment team.  The DevOps engineers create and manage different cloud services to provision and scale the software deployment during the release.  After Provisioning and scaling the new version of the software is released.
